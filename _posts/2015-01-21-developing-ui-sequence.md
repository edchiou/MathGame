title: Mocking our App's User Interface 
---

*Author: John Chou* 

In our first group meeting, we decided that we should quickly draw up a couple sketches of our game so that we could decide what needed to be done.  This blog post is going to show you what we decided on, our initial designs, the initial gameplay that we decided on, and more.

### The User Interface Flow Diagram (Drawn in CSE 4140)

As you can see, our App is composed of 

* Splash Screen
* Login Page
* Home Page 
* Options for Speedy Game
* Multiplayer or Singleplayer selection
* Speedy Game
* Summary/Results Page

With this initial design, we realized that most of our work would center on the core game play, so we proceeded to also draw up how we wanted our game to flow, the mechanics involved, and how multiplayer would work in our game.

###  Game Play

As you can see from our gameplay, we decided that it'd be more fun to have 3 columns to match up, with 2 operand numbers and an operator.  The player would use his finger to swipe from an operand, to an operator, and combine it with another operator and the numbers would join.  Once one of these joins have finished, the next set of numbers and operators drop.  Eventually, the user will match the target number and be awarded points.  

While discussing multiplayer, we thought the basic premise was to have live feed going from one phone to the other using IOS's gamecenter.  Each player would try to match the numbers together, and if one user matched the target number first, he is the only one that gets awarded points.

### Other Fun Ideas Discussed

We realized that our game was extremely versatile, and that so many unique features could be added in order to increase difficulty, the speed and pace of the game itself, and the ultimate enjoyment of the game itself.  We thought of special power ups that users could by to more easily achieve the target number, special moves that a user could use to affect another user's operators or operands, and much more.  As we began to think more and more, we realized that the possibilities were endless, but before we get too ahead of ourselves, we just got to the computer and start coding out the basics.

Thanks for Reading!
